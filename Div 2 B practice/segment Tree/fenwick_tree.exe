This file contains a TEML script that is helpful to C and C++
programmers.  To use the macros in this file run TEMC to compile
it and add it to the appropriate tcconfig.tc file.  The syntax for
this is:

TEMC cmacros.tem tcconfig.tc

This will add the macros and key definitions in cmacros.tem to what
already exists in tcconfig.tc.

              Brief editor emulation for Borland C++ IDE.

	This file contains a Turbo Editor Macro Language (TEML)
script which emulates the Brief programmer's editor in the Borland
C++ IDE.  A complete description of the TEML language and the Turbo
Editor Macro Compiler (TEMC) can be found in the file "UTIL.DOC".

	The TEMC compiler can be invoked from the DOS command line at
follows:
 
	  temc [-c] brief.tem <IDE configuration file>

The optional -c switch can also be specified as /c, and can appear in
any argument position on the command line. If you use this option,
any existing command table in your configuration file is thrown away
before the script file is merged with those already defined. The
configuration file extensions is assumed to be .TC.  The configuration
file need not exist. If it does not exist, it is created. 
tcconfig.tc is the main configuration file.

Most of the simple Brief commands have been fully implemented.  Most
of the complex commands have been either partially implemented or not
implemented at all. Below is a list of the commands that have been
fully or partially implemented.
