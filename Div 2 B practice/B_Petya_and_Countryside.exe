ill be the case for
                    objects ultimately derived from Sortable (see the
                    Related Functions section of the Sortable class
                    reference) as well as for the standard C integral
                    types.

                    Array and SortedArray are identical in many areas (they
                    have the same base, AbstractArray). One difference is
                    that SortedArray::detach "squeezes" the array to
                    maintain ascending order, while Array::detach leaves
                    "holes" in the array.

                    The instance class Stack, derived from Container, is
                    one of the sequence classes like Queue and Deque. A
                    stack is a LIFO (last-in-first-out) linear list for
                    which all insertions (pushes) and removals (pops) take
                    place at one end (the top or head) of the list (see D.
                    E Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1,
                    2.2). In addition to the traditional pop and push
                    member functions, Stack provides top, a member function
                    for examining the object at the top of the stack
                    without affecting the stack's contents. top must be

Stack



                    used with care since it returns a reference to an
                    object that may be owned by the stack. Destroying the
                    object returned by top can disrupt the internal
                    mechanism for storing the stack. The correct way to
                    dispose of the top element is to use pop followed by
                    delete. Stack is implemented internally as a List via a
                    private data member theStack of type List.

                    Timer is an instance class implementing a stop watch.
                    You can use Timer objects to time program execution by
                    calling the member functions start and stop within your
                    program, and then using time to return the elapsed
                    time. The reset member function resets the elapsed time
                    to zero. Successive starts and stops will accumulate
                    elapsed time until a reset.

                    Determines the timer resolution for all timer objects.
                    This value is hardware and OS dependent. For example:

                    TShouldDelete maintains the ownership state of a
                    container. The fate of objects that are removed from a
                    container can be made to depend on whether the
                    container owns its elements or not. Similarly, when a
                    container is destroyed, ownership can dictate the fate
                    of contained objects that are still in scope. As a
                    virtual base class for Container and Association,
                    TShouldDelete provides ownership control for all
                    containers and associations. The member function
                    ownsElements can be used either to report or to change
                    the ownership status of a container. delObj is used to
                    determine if objects in containers or associations
                    should be deleted or not.

       constructor  TShouldDelete( DeleteType dt = Delete );

                    Creates a TShouldDelete object. By default, containers
                    and associations own their elements. DeleteType is an
                    enumeration declared within the class as follows:

                    enum DeleteType { NoDelete, DefDelete, Delete };

      ownsElements  int ownsElements();
                    void ownsElements( int del );

                    The first form returns 1 if the container owns its
                    elements, otherwise it returns 0. The second form
                    changes the ownership status as follows: if del is 0,
                    ownership is turned off; otherwise ownership is turned
                    on.

            delObj  int delObj( DeleteType dt );

                    Tests the state of ownership and returns 1 if the
                    contained objects should be deleted or 0 if the
                    contained elements should not be deleted. The factors
                    determining this are (i) the current ownership state
                    and (ii) the value of dt, as shown in the following
                    table.
                    delObj returns 1 if (dt is Delete) or (dt is DefDelete
                    and the container currently owns its elements). Thus a
                    dt of NoDelete returns 0 (don't delete) regardless of
                    ownership; a dt of Delete return 1 (do delete)
                    regardless of ownership; and a dt of DefDelete returns
                    1 (do delete) if the elements are owned, but a 0 (don't
                    delete) if the objects are not owned.
