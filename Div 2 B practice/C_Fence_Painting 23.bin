           You can replace a module by first removing it, then
                    adding the replacement module.


                    File and module names
                    =======================================================

                    TLIB finds the name of a module by taking the given
                    file name and stripping any drive, path, and extension
                    information from it. (Typically, drive, path, and
                    extension are not given.)

                    Note that TLIB always assumes reasonable defaults. For
                    example, to add a module that has an .OBJ extension
                    from the current directory, you only need to supply the
                    module name, not the path and .OBJ extension.

                    Wildcards are never allowed in file or module names.


                    TLIB operations
                    =======================================================

                    TLIB recognizes three action symbols (*, +, *), which
                    you can use singly or combined in pairs for a total of
                    five distinct operations. The order of the characters

                    is not important for operations that use a pair of
                    characters. The action symbols and what they do are
                    listed here:

       To create a      +     Add            TLIB adds the named file to
      library, add                           the library. If the file has
      modules to a                           no extension given, TLIB

    not yet exist.                           If the file is itself a
                                             library (with a .LIB exten-
                                             sion), then the operation adds
                                             all of the modules in the
                                             named library to the target
                                             library.

                                             If a module being added
                                             already exists, TLIB displays
                                             a message and does not add the
                                             new module.

                        -     Remove         TLIB removes the named module
                                             from the library. If the
                                             module does not exist in the
                                             library, TLIB displays a
                                             message.

                                             A remove operation only needs
                                             a module name. TLIB allows you
                                             to enter a full path name with
                                             drive and extension included,
                                             but ignores everything except
                                             the module name.

                        *     Extract        TLIB creates the named file by
                                             copying the corresponding
                                             module from the library to the
                                             file. If the module does not
                                             exist, TLIB displays a message
                                             and does not create a file. If
                                             the named file already exists,
                                             it is overwritten.

    Using response  =======================================================
             files
                    When you are dealing with a large number of operations,
                    or if you find yourself repeating certain sets of
                    operations over and over, you will probably want to
                    start using response files. A response file is simply
                    an ASCII text file (which can be created with the Turbo
                    C++ editor) that contains all or part of a TLIB com-
                    mand. Using response files, you can build TLIB commands
                    larger than would fit on one DOS command line.

See "Examples" for  To use a response file pathname, specify @pathname at

                    o You don't need to put the entire TLIB command in the
                      response file; the file can provide a portion of the
                      TLIB command line, and you can type in the rest.

                    o You can use more than one response file in a single
                      TLIB command line.

       Creating an  =======================================================
          extended
dictionary: The /E  To speed up linking with large library files (such as
            option  the standard Cx.LIB library), you can direct TLIB to
                    create an extended dictionary and append it to the
                    library file. This dictionary contains, in a very
                    compact form, information that is not included in the
                    standard library dictionary. This information enables
                    TLINK to process library files faster.

                    To create an extended dictionary for a library that is
                    being modified, use the /E option when you invoke TLIB
                    to add, remove, or replace modules in the library. To
                    create an extended dictionary for an existing library
                    that you don't want to modify, use the /E option and
                    ask TLIB to remove a nonexistent module from the
                    library. TLIB will display a warning that the specified
                    module was not found in the library, but it will also
                    create an extended dictionary for the specified
                    library. For example, if you enter

                       tlib /E mylib -bogus

                    TLINK will ignore the debugging information in a
                    library that has an extended dictionary, unless the /e
                    option is used on the TLINK command line.


  Setting the page  =======================================================
      size: The /P
            option  Every DOS library file contains a dictionary (which
                    appears at the end of the .LIB file, following all of
                    the object modules). For each module in the library,
                    this dictionary contains a 16-bit address of that
                    particular module within the .LIB file; this address is
                    given in terms of the library page size (it defaults to
                    16 bytes).

                    The library page size determines the maximum combined
                    size of all object modules in the library--it cannot
                    exceed 65,536 pages. The default (and minimum) page
                    size of 16 bytes allows a library of about 1 MB in
                    size. To create a larger library, the page size must be
                    increased using the /P option; the page size must be a







                                  - 49 -






                    power of 2, and it may not be smaller than 16 or larger
                    than 32,768.

                    All modules in the library must start on a page
                    boundary. For example, in a library with a page size of
                    32 (the lowest possible page size higher than the
                    default 16), on the average 16 bytes will be lost per
                    object module in padding. If you attempt to create a
                    library that is too large for the given page size, TLIB
                    will issue an error message and suggest that you use /P
                    with the next available higher page size.


          Advanced  =======================================================
 operation: The /C
            option  When you add a module to a library, TLIB maintains a
                    dictionary of all public symbols defined in the modules
                    of the library. All symbols in the library must be
                    distinct. If you try to add a module to the library
                    that would cause a duplicate symbol, TLIB displays a
                    message and won't add the module.

                    Normally, when TLIB checks for duplicate symbols in the
                    library, uppercase and lowercase letters are not
                    considered as distinct. For example, the symbols lookup
                    and LOOKUP are treated as duplicates. Since C and C++
                    do treat uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct,
                    use the /C option to add a module to a library that
                    includes a symbol differing only in case from one
                    already in the library. The /C option tells TLIB to
                    accept a module with symbols in it that differ only in
                    case from symbols already in the library.

If you want to use  It may seem odd that, without the /C option, TLIB

                    then, Turbo C++ would treat stars, Stars, and STARS as
                    three separate identifiers. As long as you use the
                    library only with TLINK, you can use the TLIB /C option
                    without any problems.

          Examples  =======================================================

                    Here are some simple examples demonstrating the
                    different things you can do with TLIB.

                    1. To create a library named MYLIB.LIB with modules
                       X.OBJ, Y.OBJ, and Z.OBJ, type
                        tlib mylib +x +y +z

                    2. To create a library as in #1 and get a listing in
                       MYLIB.LST too, type
                        tlib mylib +x +y +z, mylib.lst

                    3. To get a listing in CS.LST of an existing library
                       CS.LIB, type
                        tlib cs, cs.lst

                    4. To replace module X.OBJ with a new copy, add A.OBJ
                       and delete Z.OBJ from MYLIB.LIB, type
                        tlib mylib -+x +a -z

                    5. To extract module Y.OBJ from MYLIB.LIB and get a
                       listing in MYLIB.LST, type
                        tlib mylib *y, mylib.lst

                    6. To create a new library named ALPHA, with modules
                       A.OBJ, B.OBJ, ..., G.OBJ using a response file:
                        
                       First create a text file, ALPHA.RSP, with
                        +a.obj +b.obj +c.obj &
                               +d.obj +e.obj +f.obj &
                               +g.obj
                        
                       Then use the TLIB command, which produces a listing
                       file named ALPHA.LST:
                        tlib alpha @alpha.rsp, alpha.lst

TOUCH
===========================================================================

                    There are times when you want to force a particular
                    target file to be recompiled or rebuilt, even though no
                    changes have been made to its sources. One way to do





                                  - 51 -






                    this is to use the TOUCH utility. TOUCH changes the
                    date and time of one or more files to the current date
                    and time, making it "newer" than the files that depend
                    on it.

                    You can force MAKE to rebuild a target file by touching
                    one of the files that target depends on. To touch a
                    file (or files), type

   You can use the    touch filename [filename ...]
   DOS wildcards *
 and ? with TOUCH.  at the DOS prompt. TOUCH will then update the file's
                    creation date(s). Once you do this, you can invoke MAKE
                    to rebuild the touched target file(s).

        Important!  Before you use the TOUCH utility, it's vitally
                    important to set your system's internal clock to the
                    proper date and time. If you're using an IBM PC, XT, or
                    compatible that doesn't have a battery-powered clock,
                    don't forget to set the time and date using the DOS
                    TIME and DATE commands. Failing to do this will keep
                    both TOUCH and MAKE from working properly.

                     TRANCOPY [-r] Source[.PRJ] Dest[.PRJ]

                    TRANCOPY merges the transfer items in Source with the
                    transfer in Dest; Dest gets the new transfer items.

                    If the -r option is used, the set of the transfer items
                    in Dest is replaced by the set of transfer items in
                    Source.

TRIGRAPH: A character-conversion utility
===========================================================================

                    Trigraphs are three-character sequences that replace
                    certain characters used in the C language that are not
                    available on some keyboards. Translating trigraphs in
                    the compiler would slow compilation down considerably,
                    so Turbo C++ provides a filter named TRIGRAPH.EXE to
                    handle trigraph sequences when you need to. The syntax
                    for invoking this program is as follows:

                       TRIGRAPH [-u] file(s) [file(s) ...]

                    The following table shows the trigraph sequences that
                    TRIGRAPH.EXE recognizes:


                    -------------------------------------------------------
                      Trigraph  Character
                    -------------------------------------------------------


                       ??=        #
                       ??(        [
                       ??/        \
                       ??)        ]
                       ??'        ^
                       ??<        {
                       ??!        |
                       ??>        }
                       ??-        ~

                    -------------------------------------------------------

                    TRIGRAPH.EXE works in two directions: It can convert
                    all trigraphs to their single-character representation,
                    and it can convert single characters to their trigraph
                    representation. Ordinarily, TRIGRAPH.EXE converts
                    trigraphs to single characters. You can specify the
                    inverse conversion with the -u (UNDO) command-line
                    option, which must come before any file names on the
                    command line.

                    TRIGRAPH.EXE takes any number of file specifiers,
                    including wildcards, on the command line. For each file
                    specified, it creates a backup copy of the file with
                    the original file name and an extension of .BAK, and



                                  - 53 -






                    creates a new file with the original file name and the
                    appropriate conversions performed. For example,

                       trigraph test.c test1.c

                    removes all trigraphs from the two files TEST.C and
                    TEST1.C, creating backup files TEST.BAK and TEST1.BAK.

                    As another example, the following command inserts
                    trigraphs into all the files with the extension .C, and
                    makes backup copies of all those files, giving them the
                    extension .BAK.

                       trigraph -u *.c

Transfer macros
===========================================================================

                    The IDE recognizes certain strings of characters called
                    transfer macros in the parameter string of the
                    Modify/New Transfer Item dialog box. There are three
                    kinds of macros: state, file name, and instruction.


      The transfer  State macros
 macros are listed  =======================================================
alphabetically and
 described in more  State macros are expanded according to the state of the
detail starting on  IDE. The state macros are
          page 55.

                    $DEF                          $LIB
                    $ERRCOL                       $LINE
                    $ERRLINE                      $PRJNAME


                    File name macros
                    =======================================================

                    File name macros are actually functions that take file
                    names as arguments and return various parts of the file
                    name. They allow you to build up new file name
                    specifications from existing file names. For example,
                    you can pass TDUMP a macro like this:



                                  - 54 -






                       $DIR($EXENAME)$NAME($EDNAME).OBJ

                    This macro gives you the output directory path, the
                    file name only in the active Edit window, and an
                    explicit extension. If your current directory is
                    C:\WORK, your output directory is TEST, and the active
                    editor contains MYPROG.C, then TDUMP receives the
                    parameter

                       C:\WORK\TEST\MYPROG.OBJ

                    The file name macros are

                    $DIR                          $EXT()
                    $DRIVE()                      $NAME()
                    $EDNAME                       $OUTNAME
                    $EXENAME


                    Instruction macros
                    =======================================================

                    Instruction macros tell the IDE to perform some action
                    or make some setting. The instruction macros are

                    $CAP EDIT                     $PROMPT
                    $CAP MSG(filter)              $SAVE ALL
                    $DEP()                        $SAVE CUR
                    $MEM(kb to reserve)           $SAVE PROMPT
                    $NOSWAP                       $TASM
                    

                    $CAP EDIT: This macro tells the IDE to redirect program
                    output into a standard file. After the transfer program
                    is completed, a new editor window is created, and the
                    captured output is displayed. The captured output
                    resides in a special Edit window titled Transfer
                    Output.

                    For $CAP EDIT to work correctly, the transfer program
                    must write to DOS standard output.

                    $COL: Column number of current editor. If the active
                    window is not an editor, then the string is set to 0.

                    $CONFIG: Complete file name of the current
                    configuration file. This is a null string if no
                    configuration file is defined. This macro is intended
                    for use by programs that access or modify the
                    configuration file. Besides providing the name of the
                    file, this macro causes the current configuration to be
                    saved (if modified) and reloaded when control returns
                    to the IDE.

                    $DIR(): Directory of the file argument, full path.

                    $DRIVE(): Drive of the file argument, in the form D:.

                    $EDNAME: Complete file name of file in active editor.
                    This is a null string if the active window is not an
                    editor.

                    $ERRCOL: Column number of current error in file
                    $ERRNAME. If there are no messages, then string is
                    expanded to null string.

                    $ERRLINE: Line number of current error in file
                    $ERRNAME. If there are no messages, then string is
                    expanded to null string.

                    $ERRNAME: Complete file name of file referred to by the
                    selected messages in the Message window. This is a null
                    string if there are no messages or the currently
                    selected message does not refer to a file.

                    $EXENAME: Program's file name (including output path),
                    based on the project name or, if there is no project
                    defined, then the name of the .EXE that would be
                    produced from the active editor window.

                    $EXT(): Extension of the file argument; this includes
                    the dot (for example, .CPP).

                    $INC: Pulls in the contents of the Options|Directories|
                    Include Directories type-in box.

                    $LIB: Pulls in the contents of the Options|Directories|
                    Library Directories type-in box.

                    $LINE: Line number of current editor. If the active
                    window is not an editor, then the string is set to 0.

                    $MEM(Kb to reserve): This macro tells the IDE how much
                    memory to try to give the transfer program. The IDE
                    gives up as much memory as possible, to either the
                    amount specified or the maximum available, whichever is
                    smaller. You'll get an error if no memory is specified.

                    $NAME(): Name part of the file argument; does not
                    include the dot.

                    $NOSWAP: This macro tells the IDE not to swap to the
                    User Screen when running the program. It pops up a box
                    that indicates which transfer program is running. Use
                    this macro in conjunction with $CAP.

                    $OUTNAME: This macro expands to the path and file name
                    that appear in the Project|Local Options Output Path
                    type-in box (in the active edit window). For example,
                    if the project contains STARS.C, the default Output
                    Path type-in is STARS.OBJ. So if STARS.C is in the
                    active edit window, $OUTNAME expands to STARS.OBJ. If
                    you've edited the type-in box so it says ..\MOON.XYZ,
                    $OUTNAME will expand to ..\MOON.XYZ. This macro is
                    useful when you are specifying modules for your user-
                    defined translators. For example, you could define a
                    TLIB translator and set the command line to

                    TLIB MYLIB +$OUTNAME

                    which adds the object module of the file in the active
                    edit window to the library MYLIB.

                    $PRJNAME: The current project file. Null string if no
                    project is defined.

                    $PROMPT: This macro tells the IDE to display the
                    expanded parameter string before calling the transfer
                    program. The command line that will be passed is
                    displayed in a dialog box. This allows you to change or
                    add to the string before it is passed.The position of
                    $PROMPT command in the command line determines what is
                    shown in the dialog prompt box. You can place constant
                    parameters in the command line by placing them before
                    $PROMPT. For example, the /c in

                       /c $PROMPT dir

                    is constant and doesn't show in the dialog box, but dir
                    can be edited before the command is run.

                    $SAVE ALL: This macro tells the IDE to save all
                    modified files in all Edit windows that have been
                    modified, without prompting.

                    $SAVE CUR: This macro tells the IDE to save the file in
                    the current editor if it has been modified. This
                    ensures that the invoked program will use the latest
                    version of the source file.

                    $SAVE PROMPT: This macro tells the IDE to prompt when
                    there are unsaved files in editor windows. You will be
                    asked if you want to save any unsaved files.

                    $TASM: This macro is predefined for use with Turbo
                    Assembler. It uses the TASM2MSG filter to trap TASM
                    messages. $TASM is essentially shorthand for this:

                     $NOSWAP $SAVE CUR $CAP MSG(TASM2MSG) $EDNAME,$OUTNAME

                    $WRITEMSG(filename): This macro copies the contents of
                    the Message window to the specified ASCII file. The
                    translator can parse the file and act on the messages
                    so desired. For example, $WRITEMSG(C:\MESSAGES.TXT)
                    writes to the file MESSAGES.TXT on your root directory.


       Running DOS  =======================================================
          commands
                    If you want to run DOS commands from within the
                    integrated environment, you can set up a simple
                    transfer macro that will let you do so. Just add this
                    transfer item:

                       command /c $MEM(128) $PROMPT

                    When you invoke this transfer item, a dialog box
                    appears and prompts you for DOS input. Since the
                    $PROMPT command appears later in the string, the text
                    command /c won't show up in the dialog's input box.
                    This lets you just type dir, chkdsk, del *.*, or
                    whatever DOS command you want to run.


   Transfer memory  =======================================================
          settings
                    Different programs have different memory needs. For
                    example, GREP can run in very little memory, where many
                    popular editors require 200-300K to work well.

                    If you use the $MEM() macro, you can specify (on a
                    program-by-program basis) how much memory the IDE
                    should give to the transfer programs. The less memory
                    you devote to a transfer program, the quicker the
                    transfer to and from the program occurs.

                    There may be some cases where the IDE cannot give up as
                    much memory as you requested. When this happens, the
                    IDE gives up as much as it can. There are certain
                    states in the IDE that require more memory than others;
                    for example, while debugging a program, the IDE will




                                  - 59 -






                    tie up more resources than when not debugging. Use
                    Program Reset (Ctrl-F2) to free up debugging memory.

                    In those cases where you want the IDE to give up all
                    its memory, give it a large number, like 640K. How much
                    memory is actually given up is dependent on how much
                    you have when you start Turbo C++.

Turbo Editor macros
===========================================================================

                    TEMC.EXE is an editor macro compiler for the IDE. It
                    processes a script file that defines editor macros and
                    key bindings, and produces a configuration file that is
                    read by the IDE to define the effects of keyboard
                    commands in the editor.

                    The file DEFAULTS.TEM contains the default macro
                    definitions and key bindings built into the IDE editor.
                    It serves as an example script, as well as a base from
                    which to customize the editor.



===========================================================================
TEMC command line
===========================================================================

                    TEMC is invoked from the DOS command line. Type

                     temc [-c] [-u] <script file> <config file>

                    The script file extension is .TEM if not specified
                    otherwise. The configuration file extensions is assumed
                    to be .TC.

                    The configuration file need not exist. If it does not
                    exist, it is created. The optional -c switch can also
                    be specified as /c, and can appear in any argument
                    position on the command line. If you use this option,
                    any existing command table in your configuration file
                    is thrown away before TEMC processes the script file.
                    When -c is not used, the key bindings in the script
                    file are merged with those already defined in the
                    configuration file.

                    TEMC by default modifies the commands used by the IDE
                    when the Alternate command set is specified in Options|
                    Environment|Preferences. The optional -u switch, which
                    can also be specified as /u, causes TEMC to modify the
                    CUA command set instead.

                    You can use DEFAULTS.TEM to re-create exactly the
                    default settings of the Alternate command set.  This
                    file is included as both a sample script file and as
                    the default command table. You can copy it and modify
                    it for your own use. A file named CMACROS.TEM is
                    provided with Turbo C++; this file contains many useful
                    enhancements to the IDE for C and C++ programming that
                    you may wish to install.



===========================================================================
Syntax
===========================================================================

                    The syntax to define a macro is

                     MACRO <macroname>
                       <command1>;
                       [ <command2>; ... ]
                     END;

                    <macroname> can consist of anything that is a legal C
                    symbol, and <command> can be either the name of another
                    predefined macro or a predefined TEMC editor command. A
                    list of editor commands and what they do follows.

                    When you define your macro, the following points are
                    valid:

                    1. A statement defines either a named macro or a key
                       binding.

                    2. Spaces and new lines are optional.

                    3. Comments are in C-style /* ... */ pairs.

                    4. Unlike C, TEMC's language is case insensitive.

                    5. Some of the predefined editor commands have a syntax
                       that looks like a C function call with one argument.
                       For example,



                                  - 61 -






                        
                        SetMark(5);
                        
                       Depending on the command, the argumment is either a
                       decimal integer constant, a character constant, or a
                       string literal. All are specified using C syntax.

                    Here's an example of a macro definition from
                    DEFAULTS.TEM:

                     MACRO MacScrollUp
                       ScrollScreenUp; FixCursorPos;
                     END;

                    The syntax to define a key binding is

                     <key-sequence>: <command>;

                    or

                     <key-sequence>: BEGIN <command1>; [ <command2>; ... ]
                     END;

                    The <key-sequence> is either a key (a character
                    optionally preceded by Ctrl or Alt), or a series of
                    keys separated by a plus sign (+). Note that the
                    specification of the key characters themselves is case
                    sensitive. For example, Ctrl-k+B is different than
                    Ctrl-k+b, even though the latter is the same as CTRL-
                    K+b.

                    Whitespace is allowed between the key-sequence and the
                    colon, and each <command> can be either the name of a
                    previously defined macro, or one of the predefined
                    editor commands listed in Table 1.1.



===========================================================================
Key codes
===========================================================================

                    The IDE editor makes use of an extended character set
                    that includes key combinations not normally available
                    to DOS programs. Key codes can be specified in a script
                    through any combination of the symbols "Ctrl-",
                    "Shift-" "Alt-" and a character.




                                  - 62 -






                    Some keys cannot be entered directly into a TEMC
                    script. Those keys can be referred to by their names,
                    as described in the following table.

                    Any key in a sequence--except the first key--can be
                    preceded by one of the characters ^ or @. The caret (^)
                    indicates that any combination of case and "Ctrl" can
                    be used to type the key; that is, lowercase, uppercase,
                    or control characters. The @ sign is used to indicate
                    that case is insignificant for the following character,
                    although "Ctrl" is not accepted. For example,

                    o Ctrl-k+b specifies a Ctrl-K followed by a lowercase
                      b.

                    o Ctrl-k+^b specifies a Ctrl-K followed by any of b, B,
                      or Ctrl-B.

                    o Ctrl-k+@B specifies Ctrl-K followed by either b or B.


        Named keys  =======================================================

                    Key are specified as letters, numbers, or characters,
                    optionally preceded by one or more of Ctrl-, Alt- or
                    Shift-. The following names specify keys that cannot be
                    typed as themselves in the TEMC syntax.

Predefined editor commands
===========================================================================

                    TEMC lets you use built-in editor commands and user-
                    defined macros as commands within macros
                    interchangeably, as long as you don't create any loops
                    by having two macros calling each other, even via
                    intermediate macros. Note that some commands cause an
                    escape from the editor to the surrounding IDE, for
                    example, by bringing up a dialog box. Your macro will
                    "pause" until control returns to the editor.

                    A list of all predefined TEMC editor commands is shown

                                                visible. If any adjustment
                                                is necessary, adjust the
                                                display so the cursor is

                                                are selected and makes that

              Brief editor emulation for Borland C++ IDE.

	This file contains a Turbo Editor Macro Language (TEML)
script which emulates the Brief programmer's editor in the Borland
C++ IDE.  A complete description of the TEML language and the Turbo
Editor Macro Compiler (TEMC) can be found in the file "UTIL.DOC".

	The TEMC compiler can be invoked from the DOS command line at
follows:
 
	  temc [-c] brief.tem <IDE configuration file>

The optional -c switch can also be specified as /c, and can appear in
any argument position on the command line. If you use this option,
any existing command table in your configuration file is thrown away
before the script file is merged with those already defined. The
configuration file extensions is assumed to be .TC.  The configuration
file need not exist. If it does not exist, it is created. 
tcconfig.tc is the main configuration file.

Most of the simple Brief commands have been fully implemented.  Most
of the complex commands have been either partially implemented or not
implemented at all. Below is a list of the commands that have been
fully or partially implemented.

# An example hook script to block unannotated tags from entering.
# Called by "git receive-pack" with arguments: refname sha1-old sha1-new
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.
